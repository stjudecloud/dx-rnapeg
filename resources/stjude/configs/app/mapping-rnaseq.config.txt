# mapping-rnaseq config

# Soft-clip snapping to intron/exon boundaries.
# This is used in the mapping using the custom databases.  After the
# coordinates
# are translated to genomic, and introns introduced, the code looks for cases
# where there is only a short alignment after an intron, followed by soft-
# clipping.  In these cases, it moves the soft-clip position to the end of
# the previous exon.  This is to reduce false mapping across exon junctions
# due
# to microhomology.  The number indicates how many aligned bases there may be
# for the short aligned region to be considered short.
